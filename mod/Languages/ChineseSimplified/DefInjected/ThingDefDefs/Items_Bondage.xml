  <!--EN: A high-tech locking mechanism. Features include:
- Extremely hardy, plasteel-reinforced build
- Key and lock paired using a cryptographic UID holographically embedded in a jade substrate, ensuring counterfeit keys are impossible to produce
- Self-destruct failsafe triggers when the lock is tampered with, ensuring that the protected item is destroyed rather than captured by the enemy

Originally designed for military use, the hololock has since become popular in the BDSM community, where it is customary to engrave a key and lock pair with matching names so they are easier to identify.-->
